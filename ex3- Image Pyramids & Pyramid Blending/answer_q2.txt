What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Q2: Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).
The image filters will affect the gaussian pyramid, such that the levels will be blured
with different kernels. As the kernal is larger, the spectrum of frequences is larger for each one
 of the laplacian levels, which means that more frequences will be blended with the mask.
We will see the blended image sharper- with more details.
