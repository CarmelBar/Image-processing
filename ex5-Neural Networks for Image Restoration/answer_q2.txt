suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution. A full answer consists of a description of the corruption function,
and how to properly use the restore_image() function for this task. For this context only, you could
optionally add additional operations before calling to restore_image()

Answer:
In order to solve the problem, and to estimate a high resolution image from a low resolution one I
will suggest to work as follows:
1) For training set- Use clean images, run a corruption function to get low resolution of the images.
2) The corruption function of the images can be fourier transform, and restoration with the inverse
fourier transform with low pass filter
3) Take a low-res image, and call restore_image() based on the described model
